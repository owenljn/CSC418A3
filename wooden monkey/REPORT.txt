Note: The video "Air battle.mp4" is the recorded animation of our work(Please use VLC to run it if you are using CDF machine)

Our part B is an animation of an aircraft battle.  The keyframes are consisted of 76 degrees of freedom:
        Root: It's the camera of view which has 6 DOFs,
        The enemy plane: it has 7 DOFs, and its propellers can rotate while flying. It also carries 4 missiles which can be shoot out, each of them has 6 DOFs.
        The player and other 3 planes: they all have 6 DOFs.
        The Spark is the animation to mimic the explosion, it has 9 DOFs, where "Spark Frame" controls the explosion process, "Spark Scale" can be used to change the particle size of explosion.
        The Small Shell: this is the shell fired by player and 3 other planes, it has 6 DOFs.


Prior to starting the project we both agreed to a specific approach to separate the work and attempt to complete this assignment as efficiently as possible. The first goal was to ensure we both had a decent grasp of the task. For this reason we decided to make our own aircrafts. Overall our experience collaborating on this assignment was a good one. I think we both agreed we wish we had more time (all of our other courses had assignments due this last week), but feel we did the best we could given the circumstances.
